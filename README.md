Software vendors often need to build several bundles/packages for different types of customers. All these bundles are typically assembled from the same pool of components/ Different bundles contain different subsets of these components, and components can have dependencies between them (e.g. if component C2 depends on component C1, then bundles that contain C2 must always also contain C1). This use-case is concerned with packaging families of Java applications, consisting of components comprising one or more JARs.
